Changes
-------

I started to do some cosmetic changes:

	-	use utf-8 encoding of the sources (cp1251 destroyed the display of the
		degree sign)

	-	fix naming of activies (the head version seemed to be a development stuck
		in the middle)

	-	remove google analytics

	-	adapt some requirements for modern api (ActionBar)

	-	reorder menu

	-	translate russian comments

	-	reformat sources

	-	move build to gradle

	-	dos2unix line endings

	-	rename to Tabulae
